## ❗️ Disclaimer

All the **images belong to Capcom and their respective games**. What I just did was to take some of the images of their latest games and presented in a cool interface.

## 💪 Motivation

While walking my dog I saw Capcom was close to my place, and decided to create something and presented to them. I took some of the images of the latest games and decided to create a Capcom Advisor that tells you which is your game by just telling your favourite genre and the platform you usually play on.
